## Galaxy Portfolio

Galaxy Portfolio is an experimental 3D portfolio/resume built with Three.js, where each planet represents a separate project or work experience, and clicking on a planet opens a modal window with details.

This project was built in one evening — **November 25, 2025**.

The project code is open on GitHub: [wantid/galaxy-portfolio](https://github.com/wantid/galaxy-portfolio).
