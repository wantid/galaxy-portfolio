# Vanilla Bomj Simulator (VBS)

**Vanilla Bomj Simulator** is a student project developed by a small team of three people in their free time from studies. Development took place from **March 13, 2022** to **December 8, 2023**.

## About the Project

The game tells the story of a former engineer who considers himself a brilliant designer and is obsessed with conspiracy theories. He was fired for alcoholism and stealing parts from the factory. Now he plans to build a flying saucer and fly away from people who don't understand him...

### Concept

Initially, the idea came from recreating the character movement mechanics from the first two parts of "Doom", which later evolved into the idea of turning a hurricane arena shooter into a meditative and heavy gameplay, presenting the player primarily with the task of exploring the world, rather than using it as decoration.

> "The real world doesn't need innovation, everyone is just waiting to satisfy their natural needs"

## Gameplay

### Core Mechanics

- **Combat System**: Tactile combat system with the ability to attack and dodge enemy attacks
- **Slingshot**: A weapon that allows you to put the right thoughts into enemies and solve puzzles
- **NPC Interaction**: The game world features characters who can help the main character set up a base
- **Stats System**: Strength, Stamina, Speed — affect gameplay
- **Inventory**: Canned food can be taken with you and stored at the base, vodka is drunk immediately

### Enemies

The game has four types of annoying enemies, each with individual behavior and needs:

- **Police Officer** 👮‍♂️ — their role in this world is a bit deeper
- **Cleaner** 🧹 — one of the main character's opponents
- **Rat** 🐀 — steals resources from the player, but if you catch up with it, you can get the stolen items back
- **Homeless Person** — an elderly person who can hit you if you're not on good terms with them

### Characters

- **Pigeon** 🕊️ — a quest character from whom the player can get a slingshot and more
- **Former Boxer** 🥊 — can give a punching bag to increase strength
- **Engineer** ⚙️ — helps in setting up the base
- **Thief** 🥷🏿 — operates behind garages, has parts that look like a car radio

### Items and Mechanics

- **Canned food and vodka** — restore health
- **Punching bag** — allows you to increase strength by beating it (strength affects damage dealt)
- **Pager** 📟 — transmits messages related to events in the game world, for example, the appearance of new enemies on the map
- **Watch** ⌚️ — a game item obtained from NPCs
- **Mousetrap** — allows you to stun enemies

## Visual Style

The game is made in a voxel style. The map has three types of buildings of different heights. The windows of buildings have individual drawings instead of black voids. Also, during the day you can notice less light from windows than at night.
